3. **Python 3.8+**: For running the application

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Raghu-Ng/patentpilot.git
   cd patentpilot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```bash
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   FLASK_CONFIG=development
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the drafting interface**:
   Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:5000/drafting`

## Using the Patent Drafting Module

### Step 1: Initial Questions

The first step involves providing basic information about your invention:

- **Title of Invention**: A clear, descriptive title
- **Field of Invention**: The technical field (e.g., "Computer Science", "Mechanical Engineering")
- **Brief Summary**: 1-2 lines describing what your invention does
- **Key Components**: List the main parts or elements of your invention
- **Problem Being Solved**: Describe the challenge your invention addresses

**Tips:**
- Be specific and technical in your descriptions
- Avoid marketing language
- Focus on the technical aspects

### Step 2: Background of Invention

The AI will generate a background section based on your inputs. This section typically includes:

- Introduction to the technical field
- Current state of the art
- Limitations of existing solutions
- Need for the present invention

**Features:**
- **Generate**: Creates AI-generated background content
- **Rephrase**: Improves or modifies existing content
- **Edit**: Manually edit the generated content

### Step 3: Summary of Invention

The AI generates a summary that provides:

- Overview of the invention
- Main objectives and advantages
- Key technical features
- How it solves the identified problem

### Step 4: Detailed Description

This is the most comprehensive section, including:

- Detailed explanation of each component
- How components work together
- Step-by-step implementation details
- Technical specifications and parameters
- Alternative embodiments
- Working examples

### Step 5: Claims

The AI generates patent claims that:

- Start with an independent claim (broadest scope)
- Include dependent claims (specific features)
- Use proper patent claim language
- Cover main inventive aspects

**Important**: Claims are the legal foundation of your patent. Review them carefully.

### Step 6: Drawings

Upload drawings, diagrams, or images related to your invention:

- **Supported formats**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, PDF
- **Maximum size**: 10MB per file
- **Multiple files**: You can upload several drawings
- **Descriptions**: Add descriptions for each drawing

**Tips for drawings:**
- Use clear, professional diagrams
- Include reference numbers
- Show key components and relationships
- Use black and white for better reproduction

### Step 7: Abstract

The AI generates a concise abstract (150-250 words) that:

- Summarizes the invention in one paragraph
- Mentions the technical field and problem solved
- Describes the key technical solution
- Mentions main advantages

### Step 8: Preview & Download

Review your complete patent specification and download the final document:

- **Preview**: Review all sections before downloading
- **Generate DOCX**: Download the complete specification as a Word document
- **Edit**: Make final adjustments if needed

## AI Features

### Content Generation

The AI system is trained specifically for patent drafting and:

- Uses professional, technical language
- Follows patent office requirements
- Maintains consistency across sections
- Avoids marketing or subjective language

### Rephrasing

If you're not satisfied with generated content:

1. Click the "Rephrase" button
2. Provide specific instructions (e.g., "make it more technical", "simplify the language")
3. The AI will generate an improved version

### Validation

The system includes content validation that checks for:

- Appropriate length for each section
- Technical language usage
- Patent-appropriate terminology
- Completeness of information

## Project Management

### Saving Progress

- **Auto-save**: Progress is automatically saved as you move between steps
- **Manual save**: Click "Save Progress" to ensure your work is saved
- **Resume later**: You can return to your draft at any time

### Multiple Projects

- Create multiple patent projects
- Organize drafts by project
- Track progress across different inventions

### Draft History

- View generation history for each section
- Track AI generation attempts
- Monitor content quality improvements

## Best Practices

### Content Quality

1. **Be Specific**: Provide detailed, technical descriptions
2. **Use Clear Language**: Avoid ambiguous terms
3. **Include Examples**: Provide working examples where possible
4. **Be Complete**: Ensure all sections are comprehensive

### Technical Writing

1. **Use Present Tense**: Write in present tense, third person
2. **Be Objective**: Avoid subjective or marketing language
3. **Include Details**: Provide sufficient detail for implementation
4. **Use Consistent Terminology**: Maintain consistent terms throughout

### Patent Requirements

1. **Novelty**: Ensure your invention is new
2. **Non-obviousness**: The invention should not be obvious to experts
3. **Utility**: The invention must have practical use
4. **Enablement**: The description must enable others to make and use the invention

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
